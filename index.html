                        <h4>1st Monthsary</h4>
                        <p>Months have already since we started our journey,
                            everyday comes with a new challenge and every
                            challenge comes with a new lesson and experience.
                            I can't say that our relationship is perfect but
                            our resilience and perseverance push us to what
                            we are now. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Our neediness help each other to keep us on going
                            forward and look to a new future. We may be an 
                            overthinker but our minds doesn't connect our own 
                            worlds together, it always overlap from each other.
                            However this doesn't stop us from meeting each other
                            in its epicenter.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We may have reach the point of no return even tho our
                            story is just getting started. We may also hurt each 
                            other from time to time but finding the solution was
                            always an option for the both of us, in this story of
                            ours thers's no protagonist or antagonist because it 
                            will be us. I consider you the moon of my dark world
                            and even if the new sun emerge it will never fades
                            away.

                        <p>Our time together became less to almost none, but this barrier 
                            didn't stop us to reach out and fight for one another. Through
                            the entire time that we've face an even more struggle and fierce
                            battle, even if the feelings slowly fade our love never surrender.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Even if the world tries to separate us, the distance didn't became 
                            a hurdle that will destroy us together. Instead it help our string 
                            to be stronger that ever, the string that hold us together didn't 
                            snap into two pieces, instead it stretch itself to reach our soul.

                            We may have a lot of fights, arguments, and misunderstanding but
                            despite all of that we never stop to find a solution that will 
                            help us grow and be matured to handle our own emotions even if its
                            just a tiny bit of progress it still prove that our relationship is
                            just getting started................
